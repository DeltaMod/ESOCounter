# ESOCounter
Literally counts how long it was since you pressed 4 - put this up on a second monitor to not have to worry about counting

How to use:

Open ESOCounter

Press 4

Notice that the simaris counter shows red

Don't press 4 when it's red

Warning: Currently, it will only listen in once every 0.1 seconds to find out if the button 4 is pressed, and then wait until it is depressed. Problem is, if you press 4 to quickly, it might not always catch the event. I intend to figure out a way to let it store commands for later.
